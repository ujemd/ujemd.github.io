## Video Analysis

### Mean Shift Tracking with Corrected Background

Simple mean shift based tracking using background information, based on the paper _Robust mean-shift tracking with corrected
background-weighted histogram_ by Ning et al. ![Repository.](https://github.com/ujemd/MeanShiftTracking-CBWH)

### Abandoned Object Detection

Classification of stationary objects into abandoned or stolen, based on the paper _Robust unattended and stolen object detection by fusing simple algorithms_ by San Miguel and Martinez (![Reference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4730375)).

## Natural Scene Statistics of Fused Long Wave Infrared and Visible Light Images

Small demonstration of the work presented in:

["Predicting the Quality of Fused Long Wave Infrared and Visible Light Images"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7904687/), David-Moreno D.E., Ben√≠tez-Restrepo H.D., Bovik A.C.

Which proposes fused image quality metrics and presents a subjective human study for their construction and validation. Files included are: the Matlab implementation of an *opinion distortion unaware* and an *opinion aware fused image quality analyzer*, the original raw opinion scores, Z-scores after subject rejection, and Differential Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS). Please refer to the ![repository](https://github.com/ujemd/NSS-of-LWIR-and-Vissible-Images).
